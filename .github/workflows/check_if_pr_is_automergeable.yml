name: Check if PR is automergeable


# Triggered on all PRs either by
# - completion of CI checks (status events), OR
# - tagging with "automerge" or "automerge-web" labels
# This workflow checks if the PR that invoked the trigger is automergeable. 
# A PR is automergeable iff it:
# 1) is labeled "automerge" OR "automerge-web" (originates from web submission) 
# 2) only changes plugins (subdirs of /benchmarks, /data, /models, /metrics)
# 3) passes all tests (Travis and Jenkins). 
# If all 3 conditions are met, the "automerge-approved" label is applied to the PR
# (This label triggers the `automerge_plugin-only_prs` workflow to merge the PR.)
