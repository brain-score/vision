Brain-Score is a platform to evaluate computational models of brain function 
on their match to brain measurements in primate vision. 
The intent of Brain-Score is to adopt many (ideally all) the experimental benchmarks in the field
for the purpose of model testing, falsification, and comparison.
To that end, Brain-Score operationalizes experimental data into quantitative benchmarks 
that any model candidate following the [`BrainModel`](brainscore/model_interface.py) interface can be scored on.

See the [Documentation](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io) for more details 
and the [Tutorial](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/tutorial.html) 
and [Examples](https://github.com/brain-score/candidate_models/blob/master/examples/score-model.ipynb)
for submitting a model to Brain-Score.

Brain-Score is made by and for the community. 
To contribute, please [send in a pull request](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/pulls).


## Local installation

You will need Python >= 3.7 and pip >= 18.1.
Note that you can only access public benchmarks when running locally.
To score a model on all benchmarks, submit it via the [brain-score.org website](http://www.brain-score.org).

`pip install git+https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score`

Score a model on a public benchmark:
```python
from brainscore.benchmarks import public_benchmark_pool

benchmark = public_benchmark_pool['dicarlo.MajajHong2015public.IT-pls']
model = my_model()
score = benchmark(model)
#>  <xarray.Score (aggregation: 2)>
#>  array([0.32641998, 0.0207475])
#>  Coordinates:
#>    * aggregation  (aggregation) <U6 'center' 'error'
#>  Attributes:
#>      raw:                   <xarray.Score (aggregation: 2)>\narray([0.4278365 ...
#>      ceiling:               <xarray.Score (aggregation: 2)>\narray([0.7488407 ...
#>      model_identifier:      my-model
#>      benchmark_identifier:  dicarlo.MajajHong2015public.IT-pls
```

Some steps may take minutes because data has to be downloaded during first-time use.

For more details, see the [Documentation](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io) and

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>`ValueError: did not find HDF5 headers` during netcdf4 installation</summary>
pip seems to fail properly setting up the HDF5_DIR required by netcdf4.
Use conda: `conda install netcdf4`
</details>

<details>
<summary>repeated runs of a benchmark / model do not change the outcome even though code was changed</summary>
results (scores, activations) are cached on disk using https://github.com/mschrimpf/result_caching.
Delete the corresponding file or directory to clear the cache.
</details>


## CI environment

Add CI related build commands to `test_setup.sh`. The script is executed in CI environment for unittests.
