# Brain-Score Benchmarks

**File structure**: One file per assembly with all the benchmarks inside.
                    This file contains the loading of the assembly (with eventual processing) and the benchmarks.

**Versioning**: Each benchmark is numbered by a version number. 
                Whenever the benchmark produces different scores, the version number is increased.
