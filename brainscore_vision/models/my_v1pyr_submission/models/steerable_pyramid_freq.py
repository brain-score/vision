class Steerable_Pyramid_Freq(nn.Module):
    r"""Steerable frequency pyramid in Torch

    Construct a steerable pyramid on matrix two dimensional signals, in the
    Fourier domain. Boundary-handling is circular. Reconstruction is exact
    (within floating point errors). However, if the image has an odd-shape,
    the reconstruction will not be exact due to boundary-handling issues
    that have not been resolved.

    The squared radial functions tile the Fourier plane with a raised-cosine
    falloff. Angular functions are cos(theta-k*pi/order+1)^(order).

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : `list or tuple`
        shape of input image
    height : 'auto' or `int`
        The height of the pyramid. If 'auto', will automatically determine
        based on the size of `image`.
    order : `int`.
        The Gaussian derivative order used for the steerable filters. Default value is 3.
        Note that to achieve steerability the minimum number of orientation is `order` + 1,
        and is used here. To get more orientations at the same order, use the method `steer_coeffs`
    twidth : `int`
        The width of the transition region of the radial lowpass function, in octaves
    is_complex : `bool`
        Whether the pyramid coefficients should be complex or not. If True, the real and imaginary
        parts correspond to a pair of even and odd symmetric filters. If False, the coefficients
        only include the real part / even symmetric filter.
    downsample: `bool`
        Whether to downsample each scale in the pyramid or keep the output pyramid coefficients
        in fixed bands of size imshapeximshape. When downsample is False, the forward method returns a tensor.
    tight_frame: `bool` default: False
        Whether the pyramid obeys the generalized parseval theorem or not (i.e. is a tight frame).
        If True, the energy of the pyr_coeffs = energy of the image. If not this is not true.
        In order to match the matlabPyrTools or pyrtools pyramids, this must be set to False

    Attributes
    ----------
    image_shape : `list or tuple`
        shape of input image
    pyr_size : `dict`
        Dictionary containing the sizes of the pyramid coefficients. Keys are `(level, band)`
        tuples and values are tuples.
    fft_norm : `str`
        The way the ffts are normalized, see pytorch documentation for more details.
    is_complex : `bool`
        Whether the coefficients are complex- or real-valued.

    def convert_pyr_to_tensor(pyr_coeffs, split_complex=False):
        r"""
        Function that takes a torch pyramid (without downsampling) dictonary
        and converts the output into a single tensor of BxCxHxW for use in an
        nn module downstream. In the multichannel case, all bands for each channel will be
        stacked together (i.e. if there are 2 channels and 18 bands per channel, 
        pyr_tensor[:,0:18,...] will contain the pyr responses for channel 1 and 
        pyr_tensor[:, 18:36, ...] will contain the responses for channel 2). 
        In the case of a complex, multichannel pyramid with split_complex=True,
        the real/imaginary bands will be intereleaved so that they appear as pairs with
        neighboring indices in the channel dimension of the tensor (Note: the residual bands are always
        real so they will only ever have a single band even when split_complex=True.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        pyr_coeffs: `OrderedDict`
            the pyramid coefficients
        split_complex: `bool`
            indicates whether the output should split complex bands into real/imag channels or keep them as a single
            channel. This should be True if you intend to use a convolutional layer on top of the output. 

        Returns
        -----------
        pyr_tensor: `torch.Tensor` (BxCxHxW)
            pyramid coefficients reshaped into tensor. The first channel will be the residual highpass and the last will be
            the residual lowpass. Each band is then a separate channel. 
        pyr_info: `List` 
            containing the number of channels, if split_complex was used
            in the convert_pyr_to_tensor, and the list of pyramid keys for the dictionary

        
        Note:conversion to tensor only works for pyramids without downsampling of feature maps
