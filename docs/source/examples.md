# Examples

The following examples are primarily concerned with the codebase, e.g. defining benchmarks and metrics.
For examples of how to score models, please [see here](https://github.com/brain-score/candidate_models/blob/master/examples/score-model.ipynb).

[score](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/examples/score.ipynb): 
    score a model on a benchmark

[data, metrics, benchmarks](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/examples/data_metrics_benchmarks.ipynb): 
    retrieve neural and behavioral data, compare measurements with metrics, and score models with benchmarks

[models](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/examples/models.ipynb): 
    use existing models and build new ones
