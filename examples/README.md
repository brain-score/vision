# Examples

The following examples are primarily concerned with the codebase, e.g. defining benchmarks and metrics.
For examples of how to score models, please [see here](https://github.com/brain-score/candidate_models/blob/master/examples/score-model.ipynb).

[benchmarks](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/examples/benchmarks.ipynb): 
    compare an assembly to a target assembly under a certain metric

[data](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/examples/data.ipynb): 
    obtain neural and behavioral assemblies and stimulus sets

[metrics](https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/examples/metrics.ipynb): 
    compare neural assemblies with each other
