##### NOTES ON THIS SCRIPT #####
# This script is used to create a stimulus set with the background-id included. 
# A fair question is: why do we need a model to do this? Shouldn't it depend only on the stimulus set?
# the answer is: yes, it should. But this implementation takes the already existing from previous work 
# of Marliawaty I Gusti Bagus, where the background is created as the presentation dimension of the 
#Â brain activations extracted using the 'look_at' function from the brain-score package that is called 
# on a stimulus set that doesn't have the background-id included.
# It is however independent of the model used to extract brain activations.
# FUTURE WORK should only use the stimulus set to create the background-id, and not the model activations.
